# 🛠️ ACRS@NTUT | Automation & Control Research Society  
**Automation & Control Research Society**

> A student-led research community focused on long-term system engineering.

> “We are not here to sprint for a single competition.  
> We are here to build technology for a lifetime.”

### 🔬 Research · 🧠 Design · 🛠️ Build
- **Research**: From control theory and system modeling to experimental validation, with an emphasis on reproducibility  
- **Design**: Engineering-driven system architecture, not one-off prototypes  
- **Build**: Hands-on implementation, testing, and iteration to ensure technologies can endure and be passed on

## 📖 Why ACRS Exists | The Origin

The origin of ACRS traces back to our admiration for organizations such as the **ARRC Advanced Rocket Research Center**, where research is pursued with deep commitment, as well as to overseas universities that sustain laboratory-based student research groups for decades.

In contrast, many engineering student organizations in Taiwan remain **competition-driven**—  
intense development for a single event, followed by abandoned projects, broken knowledge chains, and no long-term accumulation.

We believe valuable technical knowledge should not disappear once a competition ends.

## 🕰️ Timeline | Our Formation

- **2025/10 | Ideation Phase**  
  Core members began systematically exploring the feasibility of a research-oriented student community, focusing on  
  control systems, system modeling, mechatronics integration, and sustainable technical inheritance.

- **2025/11 | Preparation Phase**  
  A clear identity centered on **Research × Practice × Knowledge Transfer** was established.  
  Organizational structure, project governance, and educational frameworks were designed.  
  NTUT was selected as the society’s base, and founding members recruitment began.

ACRS is an **open, research-driven technical community** centered on:

- Control Systems  
- Mechatronics Integration  
- Robotic Systems  
- System Modeling and Experimental Validation  

### Our Core Principles
- **No shortcuts**: We prioritize fundamental research capability over rushed competition results  
- **Knowledge continuity**: Projects, documentation, and systems must be inheritable  
- **You propose, we support**: Any serious technical idea deserves institutional backing

## 📂 Organization | Our Teams

We value responsibility over titles. Every role has a concrete function.

### 🔧 Technical Team
- Operates under the Education function as the core R&D unit  
- Responsible for technical research, project development, and system-level decisions  
- Maintains and oversees all long-term technical projects  

### 📘 Education Team
- Translates research outcomes into structured courses and training materials  
- Builds reusable and transferable learning resources  
- Conducts internal training, workshops, and onboarding programs  

### 🧭 Executive Team | The Crew
- **President / Vice President**: External representation, internal integration, and strategic direction  
- **Secretary General**: Governance, documentation, and institutional stability  
- **Treasurer**: Financial and resource management to sustain research activities  
- **Education Lead**: Oversees curriculum, knowledge transfer, and technical project management  
- **Activities Lead**: Plans and executes workshops, hands-on events, and technical camps  
- **Equipment & Facilities**: Procurement, maintenance, and space coordination  
- **Public Relations & Outreach**: External collaboration, sponsorships, and dissemination of成果

## 💡 Project Incubator

At ACRS, ideas are expected to become systems—not slides.

1. **Open Proposal**  
   Members may submit project proposals, technical plans, or early demos at any time.

2. **Resource Support**  
   Approved projects may receive:
   - Funding or equipment support  
   - Technical mentorship  
   - Opportunities for presentation and publication  

3. **Positive Feedback Loop**  
   Projects that later receive external funding are expected to proportionally reinvest into the society,  
   enabling future initiatives to grow.

## 🔭 Technical Roadmap | From Control to Systems

ACRS views technology not as isolated projects, but as a cumulative system engineering trajectory.

We deliberately begin with **control systems**, and progressively advance toward higher-complexity domains:

- **Control Systems**  
  Establishing foundations in modeling, control theory, simulation, and experimental validation.

- **Robotic Systems**  
  Applying control to multi-DOF systems, integrating sensing, actuation, planning, and software–hardware co-design.

- **Unmanned Systems (Aerial & Mobile)**  
  Extending into high-dynamics, nonlinear, and real-time systems such as UAVs and autonomous platforms.

- **Marine & Aerospace Systems**  
  Exploring, in the long term, complex control challenges in underwater vehicles, submarines, and rocket systems.

We do not rush toward the final destination.  
Each stage must produce **reproducible, transferable technical outcomes**, allowing future members to stand on solid foundations and move further.
